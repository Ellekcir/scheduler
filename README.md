# <Work Day Scheduler>

## Description

This project was made for those with a busy daily schedule, its' functionailty provides you with present time in order to keep you on track of your daily tasks. The biggest trouble I had building this project was getting this to function correctly with the present moment and having a responsive interface. I learnt alot through reading others code and trying to type up whilst educating myself through every step. I have left alot of comments through out this project to show an understanding of every step. 

## Usage

To use this Work Day Scheduler; you are to just set your daily task within the desired time slot, then press the blue save icon in order to save it for next time the window is opened. This will hold in the local storage which I have shown in the image prived below along with a short clip of its functionality. The time is in a colour coded format to visually show wher eyou are at in the days - red is the past, light green is the future time and the highlighted green is the present.
